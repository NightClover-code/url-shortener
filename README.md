# Shortly URL shortening API Project

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./public/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
- Receive custom messages based on the link they enter (unvalid link, already shortened etc...)
- Create an account and sign up
- Login with popular services (google, facebook...) or with their account
- See the links they had shortened when they login
